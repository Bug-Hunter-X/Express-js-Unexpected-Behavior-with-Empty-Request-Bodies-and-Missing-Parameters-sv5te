# Express.js Unexpected Behavior with Empty Request Bodies and Missing Parameters

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications: how to gracefully handle requests with empty bodies or missing parameters.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the solution.

## Problem

The problem arises when an Express.js application receives a POST request with an empty body or a body missing expected parameters.  Directly accessing `req.body` properties can lead to errors if these properties are undefined.

## Solution

The solution involves adding checks for the existence of `req.body` and its properties before attempting to access them.  This avoids unexpected errors and improves the robustness of the application.
